If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in San Francisco, California; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Meotrics shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. You and Meotrics will pay the administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Meotrics to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 13.4 to be enforceable, then Meotrics will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.</p>
